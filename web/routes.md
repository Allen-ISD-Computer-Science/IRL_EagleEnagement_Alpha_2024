# Routes

This file explains all of the routes for the mobile and web API.

## Formatting

All data needs to be sent in JSON and all data will be received in JSON.

Any "Date" objects - sent or recieved, should be in ISO8601 format (`yyyy-MM-dd{T}HH:mm:ss.SSS{Z}` where anything inside {} is a constant).
